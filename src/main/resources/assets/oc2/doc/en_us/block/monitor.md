# Monitor
![Monitor](block:oc2:monitor)

The monitor, like the projector, provides a framebuffer device to [computers](computer.md). They have a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, with the color format r5g6b5: 5 bits for the red color component, 6 bits for the green color component and 5 bits for the blue color component.

Monitors need to be powered directly to function. The device bus cannot provide enough energy on its own. When insufficiently powered, this is indicated by a red error text on the screen.

On a Linux system, monitors will typically appear as `/dev/fbX` devices. To send data to the framebuffer, it is possible to write to these devices. For example, to clear a framebuffer one might pipe zeros to the device like so: `cat /dev/zero > /dev/fb0`.

The monitor provides a built-in keyboard for usage with the default Linux distro, this feature may be interrupted by having another keyboard device connected to the same computer.

Computers *have to be shut down* before installing or removing this component. Installing it while the computer is running will have no effect, removing it may lead to system errors.
